        <h1>About...Brian Gallagher</h1>
        <div class="about">
          <p><span>Welcome!</span> My name is Brian Gallagher and this is where I have claimed my corner of the Interwebz.  I am a Junior Front-End Web Developer.  Technologies I use include Javascript, ReactJS, ReduxJS, HTML5, and CSS.  I recently attended The Iron Yard’s Front-End Engineering course.  Outside of the course I have been studying Back-End Engineering technologies that include NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.</p>

          <p>I’ve always enjoyed creating things.  As a kid pieced together several model airplanes had containers full of Legos that fostered curiosity and creativity.  This curiosity and creativity, later lead me into the incredible world of technology.</p>

            </div>
          <p>I love learning what makes all my devices tic and what I can do to get the most out of them.  I started looking into how the code made them work the way it and how I could alter it to my needs.  This swung the development door wide open for me and open my eyes to the countless possibilities.</p>

          <p>I had made a career in the Healthcare software industries of 9 years, working for the same company.  I wore several hats during that time, some of include a support rep, onsite trainer, QA analyst, and management.  While I enjoyed my time wearing all of these hats, I still had a yearning for understanding how the applications I used daily operated.  During this time I had started a new hobby of home automation.  Tailoring my HA needs meant I needed to get into the code to my applications fit my needs.  As one component of the application began to fit into place, I could see the next one forming.  I was having tons of fun tinkering and writing small pieces of code and decided I wanted to make a go at this and make a pivot in my career path.</p>

                My Movie Search was a project I worked on at the end of my time at the Iron Yard in Dallas.  This app allows users to login and search for movies, tv shows, and people.  They can also save them to their own Favorites List.  Deployed on Heroku.
