        <div class="about">
          <p><span>Welcome!</span> My name is Brian Gallagher and this is where I have claimed my corner of the Interwebz.  I am a Junior Front-End Web Developer.  Technologies I use include Javascript, ReactJS, ReduxJS, HTML5, and CSS.  I recently attended The Iron Yard’s Front-End Engineering course.  Outside of the course I have been studying Back-End Engineering technologies that include NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.</p>

          <p>I’ve always enjoyed creating things.  As a kid pieced together several model airplanes had containers full of Legos that fostered curiosity and creativity.  This curiosity and creativity, later lead me into the incredible world of technology.</p>

          <p>I love learning what makes all my devices tic and what I can do to get the most out of them.  I started looking into how the code made them work the way it and how I could alter it to my needs.  This swung the development door wide open for me and open my eyes to the countless possibilities.</p>

          <p>I had made a career in the Healthcare software industries of 9 years, working for the same company.  I wore several hats during that time, some of include a support rep, onsite trainer, QA analyst, and management.  While I enjoyed my time wearing all of these hats, I still had a yearning for understanding how the applications I used daily operated.  During this time I had started a new hobby of home automation.  Tailoring my HA needs meant I needed to get into the code to my applications fit my needs.  As one component of the application began to fit into place, I could see the next one forming.  I was having tons of fun tinkering and writing small pieces of code and decided I wanted to make a go at this and make a pivot in my career path.</p>
